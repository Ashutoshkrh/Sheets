Tools and Technologies used:
React.js : React allows for building dynamic and responsive UIs. It uses a component-based architecture, which makes the code modular, maintainable, and reusable.
Tailwind CSS : Tailwind provides a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to create highly customizable and responsive UIs without writing custom CSS from scratch. It makes it easy to quickly adjust the design directly within JSX elements.
Javascript : Arrays and Objects for storing the data model (table data and cell properties) in a structured, easy-to-manipulate format.
