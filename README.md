**Mysheets :**

**Tools and Technologies used:**
React.js : React allows for building dynamic and responsive UIs. It uses a component-based architecture, which makes the code modular, maintainable, and reusable.
Tailwind CSS : Tailwind provides a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to create highly customizable and responsive UIs without writing custom CSS from scratch. It makes it easy to quickly adjust the design directly within JSX elements.
Javascript : Arrays and Objects for storing the data model (table data and cell properties) in a structured, easy-to-manipulate format.

3) Mathematical operations (sum, average, min, max, count) on a range of cells.First of all, select the range of cells, then click on âˆ‘ icon to get a drop-down, and then select whichever operation you want to perform (sum, min, max, etc); functionality is exactly similar to google Sheets, like when you select cells with no numbers, then 0 is printed and in other cases, only numbers are considered to find sum, min, etc.
When cells with both numbers and strings are selected, then only numbers are considered for the mathematical operations, as in Google Sheets.
